# SpamMail-Classifier
This project implements a spam mail classifier using machine learning in Python. The classifier is trained on a dataset of labeled emails to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. Additionally, a user-friendly web app is created using Streamlit to provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with the classifier.
