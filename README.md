# SpamMail-Classifier
This project implements a spam mail classifier using machine learning in Python. The classifier is trained on a dataset of labeled emails to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. Additionally, a user-friendly web app is created using Streamlit to provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with the classifier.
## Features
- Spam Classification:Uses machine learning algorithm(naive bayes)to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
- Web App Interface:A Streamlit web app for easy interaction with the classifier.
- Deployment:The classifier is deployed, making it accessible through a web browser.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries(scikit learn,nltk)
- Streamlit
